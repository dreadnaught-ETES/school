There are many interesting topics that relate to computers, many of which may branch off into fields one may not expect.
These topics include:
Vital and health monitoring programs and devices.
Game engines and development programs.
The input of things like elevators, microwaves, and ovens.
Practically anything to do with mobile devices.
The possibilities for true Artificial Intelligent Life. (Think Detroit:Become Human. If you haven't played it, go now and be amazed.)


As with many professions and specialities, computers are not without difficulty.
Some of the most possible challenges one may face include:
Writing clean, efficient code
If/And/Or statements
formats and their applications
Imports and which ones to use for what and where and when
Multiple option if/elif/else statements
